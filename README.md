# racemod 0.4.1
A Forge mod for 1.7.10 and 1.8.9 that normalizes enderman, blaze, and chicken drops as well as eye breaks to be based only on the seed instead of on the game's Java random generator. 

Version 0.4.1 includes a feature which lets the tournament organizer see the seed's initial blaze, pearl and eye break rates just by placing a single piece of bedrock. Throwing a piece of bedrock (with Q) has the same effect as throwing an eye, so eye RNG can be advanced without getting starter-staircased.

This is the official tournament mod for Minecraft Relay Cup 2 as well as Spinnaker's 1.7 weeklies.  For 1.7.2, download the 1.7.10 version and follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeIc6Vb-u3k) guide.
